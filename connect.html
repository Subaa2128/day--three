      <h3>What is Alexa and what can Amazon Echo do?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
      <p>
        The Amazon Echo is one of a range of hands-free speakers and devices
        from Amazon that can be controlled with your voice. The voice-controlled
        "personal assistant" on these devices is called Alexa, which will
        perform various tasks for you and control various systems.<br /><br />In
        this feature, we'll explain what Echo is and what Alexa can do.<br /><br />
        As well as being available on Echo devices from Amazon directly, Alexa
        is available on a lot of third-party devices like speakers or TVs as
        well as through the Alexa app on phones. Alexa is also available in some
        cars and in some wearables.

      <h2>What devices offer Alexa?</h2>
      <p>
        There are two sides to this question - devices that work with Alexa
        (such as Philips Hue) - and devices that offer Amazon Voice Services,
        which is the platform that runs Alexa.<br /><br />
        First and foremost, Alexa is designed around Amazon's own Echo devices.
        The Amazon Echo range includes the Echo and Echo Dot, which are all
        speakers, and then the Echo Show models which also feature a display, so
        can give you visual feedback, like weather widgets, videos or song
        lyrics. There are several Amazon Alexa gadgets too, like the Echo Wall
        Clock and Echo Flex plug for example. <br /><br />The cheapest Echo
        device is the Echo Dot, which is a good starting point for building an
        Echo system and getting started. You can see all the Echo devices
        compared right here.

      <h2>What can Alexa do?</h2>
      <p>
        Alexa is able to play music, provide information, deliver news and
        sports scores, tell you the weather, control your smart home and even
        allow Prime members to order products from Amazon. Alexa sits in the
        cloud, expanding the information offered all the time and refining the
        responses to give you more accurate information. No matter what Alexa
        device you ask, all can return these sorts of answers, be that on your
        soundbar or in your car.<br /><br />
        One of the core functions is playing music and Alexa can draw many
        sources. Amazon Music is supported, of course, but beyond that, there's
        support for many more services like Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music, TuneIn
        as well as apps from individual providers, like the BBC.
